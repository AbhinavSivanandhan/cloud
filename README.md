# Model.earth Cloud 2025

1. Fork and clone our [cloud repo](https://github.com/modelearth/cloud) and [localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite). 

2. Turn on GitHub Pages for both. So [account].github.com/cloud works.

3. In the "team/2025" subfolder, add a folder with your handle (firstname) from our [Member List](https://model.earth/community/members). Use lowercase.

4. Copy the index.html page and put your handle in the title. Also good to include additional first names that are okay to display publically. ([Sample folder](team/2025/loren) you can copy)

5. Add a brief bio in a README.md file in your folder. You are welcome to include your resume and/or a link to it.

6. Submit a pull request with your new folder, and include a URL link to it whenever sending an email to Loren to pull your additions.


Generally avoid commiting datasets in the cloud repo. 
Pull data directly from GitHub, Google Sheets and APIs.
